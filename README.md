# Data-Visualization

About:

In this data visualization project I have made various different types of graphs and various other types of data representation and visualization 2-D models using the Matplotlib module in Python. f you are new to Matplotlib Module then let me explain, it is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It also makes easy things easy and hard things possible. It is also used to create publication, quality plots, interactive figures that are capable to be zoomed, paned and updated.

How to run it on your machine?:

You can run and experiment with all these codes on Google Colab which you can use online and you would not be requiring any other extra installation in your machines. Link for google collab: https://colab.research.google.com/.
